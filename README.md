Safe Trade application

Reminder, in order to see the website, you need to clone the current repository, cd into backend folder, then "npm install". cd into Frontend/frontendapp then "npm install" command. Make sure you have mongodb compass

Once you done the step, open two terminals. First one you can cd into the Backend Folder. Then run "npm run dev". The server will then start.

Then the second terminal, you cd into the Frontend/frontendapp. Then you run "npm start". The app will start without an issue.

If you have any problems running the app, the issue should be resolved by running "npm install" (if you haven't run it) for both folder (Frontend/frontendapp & Backend). 

To install Mongodb Compass, go to the following link: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/
